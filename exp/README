26 May 2015: In order to process the simulation runs produced before this date, 
checkout commit 9fab2d31c4038a3598ced237d1688cb84a34f384 in the qraat server code
base. Revisions to the ``class BootstrapCovariance`` are not backwards compatible. 

one     -- Noise versus sample size
angle*  -- Affect of angle on distribution
dist*   -- Affect of distance on distribution
grid*   -- Covariance / BootstrapCovariance over for several positions
contour -- Fine-grained, large scale, no covariance
asym    -- Covariance in large sample limit
